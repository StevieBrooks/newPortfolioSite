            <p class="blog-intro"><em>I played a football-related game called “Tunnel of Death” when I was in secondary school. It was nothing short of painful. Recently, I completed another tunnel of death called Codecademy’s Full-Stack Engineer Path. Now before I continue, please don’t let my morbid indictment send you into dismay. Codecademy are not the ones at fault here, I am. </em></p>

            <p>Throughout this post, I intend to break down - I’m already on the edge! - all aspects of this online course. I’m hoping to remain as objective as possible during this Codecademy review. Adding to this, I will also detail my own shortcomings. This is in the sincerest hope that you don’t make the same mistakes I have. This isn’t a novel so I will remove all suspense this instant. There are plenty of positive things to say about Codecademy. </p>

            <h2>I’ll get to the Codecademy review…</h2>

            <p>Before I go on, I suppose it’s prudent to give you some background information. After all, there’s nothing quite as bewildering as being thrown in at the deep end. So here goes. My coding journey began in June 2022 when I was convinced life was going nowhere. Oddly, I was on the cusp of getting married. I'm also starting to build my brand, Brooks[ode, and things are starting to take shape. That being said, I have felt compelled to provide stability for my family. After scanning the web, I found an extensive training program in the realm of IT.</p>

            <div class="blog-img-container-2">
              <img src="pics/clement-helardot-95YRwf6CNw8-unsplash.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 rounded">
              <p class="img-caption mt-2 text-center">Photo Credit: bla bla bla</p>
            </div>

            <p>Herein lies problem number one. Emotionally, I wasn’t in the best of places at the time. I had been separated from my sweet and lovely better half for nearly 3 years because of the pandemic. Granted, I was now back in Southeast Asia, but living here on one-month visas. At this point, I was in Thailand, alone, and hungover.</p>

            <h2>Terrific start, eh!</h2>

            <blockquote>"I quit my job to devote myself entirely to my IT training..."</blockquote>
            
            <p>Because of these factors, desperation, and a sense of urgency that had been inflicted by the program organisers, I made my purchase. The program set me back £1400 and comes with a job guarantee upon completion. Given that they’ve promised a starting salary of at least £25k per year, it was hard to resist. Moreover, I understand that career prospects are mighty fine in the IT field.</p>

            <p>Initially, I was given a year to complete this program. However, the literature I was sent suggested that it could be completed in its entirety given 3 months of full-time study. After freezing my account for a few months to get settled in Vietnam as a married man, I quit my job to devote myself entirely to my IT training.</p>

            <p>I hated it immediately as the course materials were badly thrown together. The first instructor was no more enthusiastic than a child visiting a retirement village. The second instructor went through everything way too quickly and spent all his time speaking, rather than doing. Moreover, he looked like a kid who used to bully me. This only made me detest him. Neither instructor was motivating in the slightest. Adding to this, they offered no encouragement to students to try this stuff out themselves.</p>

            <p>The third instructor - who did the Python course - was much better. His jovial personality inspired engagement and he was constantly encouraging you to ‘make it and break it’, etc. One out of three who was worthwhile. Great start.</p>

            <p>Once I had completed the initial stage of this four-section program, I got in touch with the powers that be. The first thing they did was informally congratulate me before casting me off to Codecademy. Initially, I was just thrilled to have those lousy video courses behind me. Therefore, I was thrilled to be starting section two of the program. However, I soon came to realise the unambiguous ballache of the situation.</p>

            <h2>Let the Codecademy review commence</h2>

            <p>For the first few weeks, I felt like a kid in a sweet shop. Perusing around the Codecademy platform and really beginning to feel like I belonged to a community. It was terrific. Codecademy has its own realm on Discord and there’s also a dedicated forum for students to mingle on. Furthermore, there are often encouragements during the lessons to get involved in the tech discussions.</p>

            <p>I managed to navigate my way through the first 10 or so modules with swift execution. They focus on HTML and CSS which I had already built a reasonable understanding of. Plus, I learned a few additional nifty little tricks. Had I written my Codecademy review by this point, I suspect it might have been more positive.</p>

            <p>Once I was in double figures, I was introduced to JavaScript. The apprehension had been killing me for numerous reasons. I was well aware that this programming language would take some getting used to. Plus, the instructor in the previous course I had taken was pitiful.</p>

            <p>I would also like to mention a few things about the layout and aesthetics of the Codecademy platform. There is little to offer in the way of complaints. The platform is easy to navigate and looks inviting. Once you’re logged in, your home page displays the most recent course you’re doing. Additionally, courses that you have recently completed are listed below. One feature that I especially like is that certificates can be downloaded very easily as PDFs. Simply go to your profile by clicking your avatar in the top right, scroll down and page and click ‘certificate’. Another belting option is that any certificate you’ve obtained can be directly uploaded to your LinkedIn profile. Again, more plus points for this Codecademy review.</p>

            <h2>What are the benefits of Codecademy?</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Access to dozens of free courses</li>
              <li>Very easy platform to navigate</li>
              <li>Courses are well-structured and exceptionally easy to follow</li>
              <li>Boatloads of information</li>
              <li>Cheat sheets and an active community</li>
              <li>Downloadable certificates; sharable on LinkedIn</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Without any doubt, I can understand how Codecademy would be a great website for some learners. The structure is exceptionally easy to follow. The full-stack engineer course is divided into 50 or so modules and those are typically split into between 5 and 15 units. Each unit contains a hodgepodge of lessons, quizzes, articles and informationals. All in all, this course is densely populated with information.</p>

            <div class="blog-img-container-2">
              <img src="pics/clement-helardot-95YRwf6CNw8-unsplash.jpg" alt="" class="w-100 rounded">
              <p class="img-caption mt-2 text-center">Photo Credit: bla bla bla</p>
            </div>

            <p>The lessons are generally split into between 5 and 15 pages and each page contains several paragraphs of information as well as a handful of exercises. The great thing about these exercises is that should you get confused, hints are available. Moreover, if you still can’t solve the problem after running your solution, there is a ‘Review Concept’ button in the bottom right of the text editor. If you’ve still not nailed it after your next attempt, this button transforms into a ‘Solution’ button.</p>

If you’ve still not nailed it after your next attempt, this button transforms into a ‘Solution’ button.</p>

            <p>At the bottom of every lesson page, links to the Codecademy community and additional learning resources are available. On top of that, cheatsheets are available at the head of many units and they can be downloaded as PDFs. This is one method by which I will personally be revising course content.</p>

            <h2>Let's hear some of the drawbacks...</h2>

            <ul>
              <li>Users must be self-motivated in order to complete</li>
              <li>Not enough video content; these courses are heavily based on reading</li>
              <li>Exercises and projects feel tedious after a while</li>
              <li>No real emphasis on problem solving. Solutions readily available</li>
              <li>Certifications not taken that seriously by recruiters</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It’s difficult to go into this part and remain objective at the same time. However, my biggest qualm is that Codecademy doesn’t exactly help to cultivate that programming mindset. Their approach to education is through a copy/paste, hand-holding mentality. I felt like a 40-year-old virgin being marched to the laptop shop by my mum. Generally, the content was delivered in layman’s terms which is great. However, it is so easy to click the solution button whenever you’re feeling frustrated. This in itself is infuriating. I’m in my programming infancy. How many toddlers do you know that want you to complete their oversized jigsaw puzzle?</p>

            <div class="blog-img-container-1">

            </div>

            <p>Another huge hang-up of mine is that there was nowhere near enough video content, given the size of the course. At least 90% of this course is reading. Don’t get me wrong, I love reading. However, I’m talking about physical books or at least a Kindle Paperwhite. Trying to focus on reading so much from a screen and then complete coding tasks is a diabolical strain on the eyes. Moreover, this can also lead to a lot of stress. The course contains far too much reading when there is plenty of this that could have been condensed into a few minutes of quality video footage. As developers, we’re gonna be spending enough time reading text from a screen anyway.</p>

            <h2>Closing the lid on this Codecademy review</h2>

            <blockquote>"To round up this post, I admit to cutting as many corners as possible..."</blockquote>

            <p>It is because of the relentless reading and the copy/paste approach that I came to resent this course. I’ve read that every developer goes through dark days. Well, many of mine have been due to the Codecademy course. By the 10th module, I had lost all motivation to do any of the projects constructed by this platform. By the 30th module, I barely did any of the exercises anymore. I was like the chubby kid in the hurdles race that kicked the buggers over instead of jumping over them.</p>

            <p>This hand-holding learning style did absolutely nothing for me; nothing was sinking in. I simply continued reading in the vain hope that I would vaguely remember the key pieces of information. After all, I’m certain that I’ll be revisiting many of the topics in future. Albeit, I would rather be force fed moldy sandwiches than take another course from this platform.</p>

            <p>Everyone has different learning styles. Therefore, it would be unfair to proclaim that Codecademy is a total crock of shit. If you learn most effectively with step-by-step walkthroughs, this course is for you. Moreover, the prices are excellent. You’ve got access to dozens of courses for free. The Plus-package will cost you a few cups of coffee and gives you access to everything. This is the membership level I would recommend.</p>

            <p>I wholeheartedly admit that my attitude towards this course hasn’t been the most positive. I was in a rush to complete it because I wanted to change my career quickly. Moreover, as I was living off savings, the urgency was escalated by even more drama. This was a choice that I had made myself and it was the wrong choice. To round up this post, I admit to cutting as many corners as possible. This is not the way to approach learning something new.</p>
